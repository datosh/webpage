## Docker

@TODO: What is Docker? Why do we use it here?

### Installation of Docker-CE on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Since Version 17.03 Docker is now distributed as a Docker-CE and a Docker-EE
version. Most package managers have not included these new executables. Docker
provides many guides on how to
[Install Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce)
on your Platform.

For my system, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, the following steps were needed to add the
docker repository to my package manager, and install Docker CE.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
# Verify import of key
$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-install docker-ce
```

Checking the Docker-CE version should print something like:

```sh
$ docker --version
Docker version 17.09.0-ce, build afdb6d4
```

Next we should add our user to the `docker` group so we are able to execute
docker commands without `sudo`, i.e., `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. Log
out and back in to get the desired permissions.

**NOTE:** This has
[some security implications](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface)
so you might want to skip this step.

### Spinning Up A Sample Container

At this point, we should test that everything is working correctly by running
the hello-world container

```sh
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
5b0f327be733: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:b2ba691d8aac9e5ac3644c0788e3d3823f9e97f757f01d2ddc6eb5458df9d801
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

[...]
```

If you have never worked with Docker before, you should check out their
documentation. They have a short
[Introduction To Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
and it might help follow the next steps. I will try to explain each step as I
go, but their documentation is superb and it does not make sense to repeat
everything.

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used to, @TODO

Docker Compose is bundled with the Docker installation on Mac and Windows
systems. On Linux machines we have to install it separately. The corresponding
[Docker Compose Github Release Page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)
has all necessary information. For my system, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, I did the
following:

```sh
$ sudo sh -c 'curl -L \
    https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.16.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` \
    > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose'
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Note we need the `sudo sh -c` workaround, since `sudo curl` will not give us
permissions to pipe into the `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

## Vagrant  @TODO: Move to Jekyll install guide.

```sh
vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64


sudo apt-get install ruby`ruby -e 'puts RUBY_VERSION[/\d+\.\d+/]'`-dev
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install jekyll bundler

vagrant up
```
